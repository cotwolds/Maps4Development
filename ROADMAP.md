## Roadmap

Project: Africa Maps4Development

Africa Maps4Development's object is to create an integrated map portal that ingests government data (open APIs), GIS information and crowd-sourced information. This information can then be used by local non-for-profits, and international development AID agencies to help plan and resource local projects such as off-grid energy infrastructure (micro-grid development), health and sanitary intervention (such as vaccinations, bed nets, or water pumps).

The project is divided into three phases:

(1) survey of available open APIs, GIS and other pertinent information that can be ingested into a map portal

(2) creation of an open source map portal to ingest above data

(3) discemmination & feedback from the international NGO and development community

### Stage 1
