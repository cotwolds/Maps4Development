## Roadmap

Project: Africa Maps4Development

Africa Maps4Development's object is to create an integrated map portal that ingests government data (open APIs), GIS information and crowd-sourced information. This information can then be used by local non-for-profits, and international development AID agencies to help plan and resource local projects such as off-grid energy infrastructure (micro-grid development), health and sanitary intervention (such as vaccinations, bed nets, or water pumps).

The project is divided into three phases:

(1) survey of available open APIs, GIS and other pertinent information that can be ingested into a map portal

(2) creation of an open source map portal to ingest above data

(3) discemmination & feedback from the international NGO and development community

### Stage 1
Survey of available information will be located here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1RxKMDdDFOHMh3mf0252Lmmy4jjr_AWA6eTGNwAu-s/edit#gid=0

1. Review existing material and on the internet. Find existing orgs or websites that provide lists.
2. List on googledoc speadsheet.


### Stage 2

1. Creation in python of map portal in specific geographic region
2. Ingestion of open APIs, convert coordinates to lat.long. Extrapolate to map.
3. Ingestion of external data (World Bank, IFC, SD4All etc) of existing projects
4. Open call for data amoungst the development/NGO community to geotag pertinent info.

### Stage 3
1. Disceminate via email and newsletters map portal information.
2. Hyper-link survey to get feedback on minimum viable information via end-users (interational development)
